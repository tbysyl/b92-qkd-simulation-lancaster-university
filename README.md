Semi-heuristic theoretical simulation of B92 QKD protocol.

Features:

- Allows for different basis angles (currently hardcoded, can be easily changed)
- Allows for selection of the number of transmitted bits
- Performs simulation as many times as required
- Calculates QBER

I plan to add support to generate graphs.

(This code may not be optimal, and does not handle errors. This repo is mainly for the people on this project
and we know how to use it.)
